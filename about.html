    <p>Primula et Ossa is here to provide Tarot readings and handmade, bespoke metaphysical products.
        Whether you're looking for an insight in to your work or love life, or a handmade candle to help you find peace and center yourself, we're sure to have something different for you.</p>
    <p>Tarot readings are arranged through our contact form, and we aim to be accessible when you are. We are currently working on providing remote services over video call but are happy to offer local readings around the Reno/Sparks area.</p>    
    <p>Started as an idea between friends, Primula et Ossa is the product of following intuition and pursuing dreams. In 2021, Danielle left her office job to pursue much more spiritually fulfilling endeavors. In doing so, she has been able to connect with the world and universe around her.</p>
    <p>This spiritual journey has allowed her to hone her Tarot skills and become more adept at making bespoke candles and charms filled with intention and purpose.</p>
    <p>Each reading is deeply personal and although Danielle aims to answer whatever questions you may have, her goal is to pass on any message the universe may for you.</p>
